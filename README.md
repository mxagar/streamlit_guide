# Streamlit Guide

This is a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) guide in which 12 data science web apps as built. The original repository is from [Chanin Nantasenamat, Ph.D.](https://github.com/dataprofessor): [streamlit_freecodecamp](https://github.com/dataprofessor/streamlit_freecodecamp). I extended the repository with my notes: [`Streamlit_Guide.md`](Streamlit_Guide.md). The repository has also a [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) course by Dr. Nantasenamat: [Build 12 Data Science Apps with Python and Streamlit - Full Course](https://youtu.be/JwSS70SZdyM).

If you're looking for a written tutorial, just open [`Streamlit_Guide.md`](Streamlit_Guide.md) and follow it by checking the code in the app folders.
